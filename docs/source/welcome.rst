What Is Coding?
===============
***If you don't care for knowing the origins of computers and coding, skip this page.***

Computers aren't just fancy machinery in a box; actually, the term used to be applied to humans!
Computers used to be humans who did calculations manually.

Let's go to the history of non-human computers...
The first one was the abacus, earliest form believed to be in 2500 BCE, but the Chinese abacus was believed to be in 500 BCE.
Then, in 1642, the Pascaline - Blaise Pascal invented a mechanical calculator, a very early attempt for automatic calculations.
Jacquard Loom in 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard made a loom controlled by punch cards.
And in 1937, the Analytical Engine - Charles Babbage conceptualized the first mechanical general computer. Never fully built. Charles Babbage is basically the father of general purpose computers.

Now, let's skip to 1937 when the ABC, the first electronic digital computer was created by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry. (Big red dog helping with making computers???!??!! no way!??!?!)
Then in 1941, the Z3 was made. The first programmable computer, made by Konrade Zuse.

Another skip in history, to 1943! The Colossus made by British codebreakers just to break German ciphers during WW2.
